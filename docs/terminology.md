# Terminology

## Block

A block is an orthogonal clump of units (_i.e. a line segment, rectangle,
cuboid, hyper... you get the idea_) and so can be easily defined by 2 opposite
ends/corners in any dimension.

## BlockSet

A blockset is a disjoint set of blocks that resolves any layout of units in a
concise and consistent manner.

## Normalising

A layout of units can be described in a multitude of ways using blocks in an
additive and subtractive manner. 

Normalising, is the process of mapping that
state to a set of disjoint blocks in a consistent fashion such that matching
layouts are always resolved to the same set of blocks regardless of how they
were constructed.

## Unit

A single amount of space in any dimension (i.e. 1x1 square, 1x1x1 cube)
